# ScanBarApp - app for scanning and anylizng barcodes
The aim of the diploma thesis was to create and implement a mobile application for barcode scanning and analysis. In addition, as part of the project, a second computer application was created, which serves as a server for receiving scanned codes from the application and pasting them into the currently running program. Both programs are based on the JAVA programming language. The description contains information on the processes of: planning, design and then the system implementation itself.

Second program is not available - code was written just in 2 days and there is nothing to be proud about :D
Anyway, I will improve it a little bit and place it in this or different project soon. :)
